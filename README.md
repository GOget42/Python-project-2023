# Python-group project-2023- Sales prediction using ML
1)We use the Walmart database
2)import models for data learning(linear regression), import algorithm and other libraries(ex.numpy,matplotlib...)
3)Process data: dealing with outliers, missing and deleting data we do not need(based on the chosen dataset)

4）define the correlations between different variables to find which one can be a valid independent variable for prediction:
a) seasonality
b) other randomness 

5)Split the dataset into training and testing sets

6)Train the model (and evaluate its performance)

7)Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new or future data.
8)Visualize Results: Create visualizations to compare predicted vs. actual sales and understand how well the model is performing.
9)Deploy the Model(final check of program performance): if the model can perform well, we should be able to deploy it to make real-time predictions.
（interface to be created if possible）
