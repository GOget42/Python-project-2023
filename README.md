# Python-group project-2023- Sales prediction using ML
1)which database to use? (amazon?)
2)import models for data learning(linear regression), import algorithm and other libraries(ex.numpy...)
2)Process data: dealing with outliers, missing and delete data we do not need(based on the chosen dataset)
3)Split the dataset into training and testing sets
4)Train the model (and evaluate its performance)
5)Make Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on new or future data.
6)Visualize Results: Create visualizations to compare predicted vs. actual sales and understand how well the model is performing.
7)Deploy the Model(final check of program performance): if the model can perform well, we should be able to deploy it to make real-time predictions.
